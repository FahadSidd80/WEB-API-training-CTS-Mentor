 Scaffold-DbContext "server=(localdb)\MSSQLLocalDB;database=empEF;integrated 

DI:-

As a developer, we create lots of objects in application but we never.
1. write code to destroy them
2. clear memory

3. Never write Destructor
4. Never implement Idisposable

why ?

Because we are been told -- GC -- Garbage collector will do it for us

but when > - at a random time.

--- but we cannot rely on that.
